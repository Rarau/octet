# Physics Playground and Toon Shader (for Octet)

This is a demo project for the first assignment of Tools and Middleware module.

Mainly it focuses on the usage of bullet physics engine and its different types of **joints** and mouse picking using **raycast**.

It also integrates a lightweight **library** (AntTweakBar) for drawing some UI elements which provide useful debug information.

Finally a custom **fragment shader** has been developed to give the whole scene a caroonish look using a light ramp.

The user can move around the scene using the following controls:
	-Move around: WASD
	-Look around: Hold right mouse button
	-Drag objects: Left mouse button
