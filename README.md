# TMX Map loader with normal mapping for Octet

This is a project for the Intro to Programming module in Goldsmiths's MsC in Computer Games and Entertainment.

It consists on a simple demo for rendering TMX map files (http://doc.mapeditor.org/reference/tmx-map-format/) which can be authored with an external editor called Tiled Editor (http://www.mapeditor.org/)

Although the project runs inside the Octet framework, the rendering is done directly in OpenGL.

Currently the program supports only one point light, however support for more could be added easily.
